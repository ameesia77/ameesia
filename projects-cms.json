Harvey Rayner incorporated elements from Rothko, Pollock, and Lichtenstein — borrowing from the lexicon of abstract expressionism and pop art to build something entirely new. First-come-first-served live minting throughout the night. Assisted in social media and sale promotion, exhibition design and gallery setup.

      "fullDescription": "The first digital release from a four-decade computational art pioneer whose work is in the permanent collections of the Centre Pompidou, Whitney Museum, SFMOMA, and Smithsonian American Art Museum. 15 Neural Style Transfer compositions created in 2018: photographs from Claude Monet’s gardens at Giverny merged with images of rusted industrial surfaces — a meditation on transformation, nature reclaimed by time, the algorithmic eye parsing beauty from decay. Among the earliest artistic applications of the technique. Legrady holds a Guggenheim Fellowship and trained under AI pioneer Harold Cohen. His installation Making Visible the Invisible has run continuously at Seattle Public Library (OMA/Rem Koolhaas) since 2005.",
